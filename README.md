• Basic DNI criteria. I don't have a proper DNI I block freely or just won't interact

For Pony Town:
• C + H whenever you feel like it.
• W2I unless my status shows as online, but even then a whisper would be appreciated because I'm not always at my device or looking at the screen
• Take inspiration whenever just don't blatantly copy my skin.

• Fandoms I'm in are: The Amazing Digital Circus, Warrior Cats, Dandy's World, Regretevator, Sonic The Hedgehog, Object Shows, Pokémon, and Undertale/Deltarune

• More things about me is that I'm a Folly Regretevator Yume, I'm fine with doubles just don't be annoying. I like cats and guinea pigs. I like listening to music, I don't mind the genre as long as it sounds good to me. I'm also a furry but I don't have a fursuit yet sadly
