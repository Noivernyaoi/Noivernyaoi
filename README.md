• Basic DNI criteria. I don't have a proper DNI I block freely or just won't interact. 

• With that being said though; -15 please do not interact or try to befriend me. If I befriend you and then discover you're under 15 years old you will be blocked, no exceptions

For Pony Town:
• C + H whenever you feel like it.
• W2I unless my status shows as online, but even then a whisper would be appreciated because I'm not always at my device or looking at the screen
• Take inspiration whenever just don't blatantly copy my skin.

• More things about me is that I'm a Folly Regretevator Yume. My favorite animals are cats, tigers, guinea pigs, and foxes. I like listening to music, I don't mind the genre as long as it sounds good to me. I'm also a furry! Also my birthday is March 1st.
